# AgileFlow: Product Owner Strategy Guide

This guide explains the specialized discovery and estimation tools available in the **PO Workspace**. These tools are designed for the "Pre-Backlog" phase where features are sized and strategic capability is modeled.

## 1. Engineering Profile & Maturity (The Baseline)
Before estimating a feature, a PO must understand the *Engine* that will build it. 
- **Maturity Modeling**: Adjust Regression, Automation, and CI/CD levels to see your **Team Capacity Score**.
- **Leverage Metrics**: Balance Junior vs. Senior ratios and Offshore leverage to understand the risk profile of your upcoming product launch.
- **AI Adoption**: High AI adoption scores reduce the estimated effort for standard coding tasks.

## 2. Strategic Feature Estimator (The Refinement)
Use this desk to price a new feature or product modification before it enters the developer backlog.
- **Story Context**: Provide the requirement.
- **Tech Stack**: Define the technology (e.g., "React/AWS" vs. "Legacy Java").
- **Complexity Variables**: Set separate complexity scores for Development and Testing. 
- **Output**: The system calculates **Story Points** (relative size) and **Effort** (person-hours) based on your Team Capacity Score from Screen 1.

## 3. Reporting & Strategic Trends (The Forecast)
A high-level view for stakeholders to see organization-wide progress.
- **Story Volume Trend**: Tracks the rate of feature discovery.
- **Data Density**: Measures if your requirements are getting more complex over time (potentially signaling feature creep).
- **KPI Insights**: Real-time analysis of Release Stability and Tech Debt ratios.
